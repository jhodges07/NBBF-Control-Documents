Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Non-Authoritative Companion Document
Scope: Public presentation, social media formatting, and external linking

--------------------------------------------------

1. Purpose

This document defines the standardized format for publishing, sharing,
and referencing Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF) content in public,
social media, and educational contexts.

Its purpose is to:
- Enable clear, consistent public communication
- Preserve precision while increasing reach
- Prevent dilution, paraphrase drift, or misrepresentation
- Ensure every public reference points back to authoritative source material

This document does not create authority.
It governs presentation only.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Authority Relationship

The authoritative documents of NBBF are those numbered 00–11.

This guide:
- Does not override
- Does not reinterpret
- Does not modify

Any conflict between this guide and an authoritative document
is resolved in favor of the authoritative document.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Canonical Section Identification

All NBBF content must be referenced using the canonical format:

NBBF <DocumentNumber>.<SectionNumber>

Examples:
- NBBF 06.1
- NBBF 06.7
- NBBF 02.16

Section identifiers are stable and may not be renumbered
without updating the authoritative source document.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Standard Social Media Block Format

Public-facing excerpts must use the following structure:

NBBF <XX.Y>. <Section Title>

<2–3 sentence plain-English summary of the rule or principle>

Key rules:
- Bullet
- Bullet
- Bullet

Reference:
https://BlueprintLiberty.com/NBBF/<XX>#<XX.Y>

No additional commentary may be inserted inside the block.

--------------------------------------------------

5. Linking Rules

Every public excerpt must include:
- A direct reference URL
- The document number
- The section number

Links must point to:
- The authoritative document
- The exact section anchor where possible

If section anchors are unavailable, links must resolve
to the document landing page.

--------------------------------------------------

6. Editing and Paraphrasing Rules

Public excerpts:
- May shorten language
- May simplify sentence structure
- May reduce word count

Public excerpts may not:
- Change meaning
- Introduce new terms
- Remove constraints
- Add interpretation or opinion

If meaning cannot be preserved through reduction,
the section must be quoted verbatim.

--------------------------------------------------

7. Platform Independence

This format is platform-neutral and applies equally to:
- Websites
- Blogs
- X / Twitter
- Threads
- Truth Social
- Gettr
- Presentations
- Educational materials

Platform-specific truncation does not permit content alteration.

--------------------------------------------------

8. Attribution and Traceability

All public uses of NBBF content must:
- Retain the NBBF section identifier
- Retain the reference link
- Preserve traceability to source documents

Screenshots, images, or excerpts without reference
are considered incomplete representations.

--------------------------------------------------

9. Derivative Content Rule

Derivative content may:
- Explain
- Illustrate
- Teach

Derivative content may not:
- Redefine
- Substitute for
- Override

Derivative content must always link back
to the authoritative NBBF source.

--------------------------------------------------

10. Publication North Star

Clarity over virality.
Precision over persuasion.
Structure over slogans.

Every share should strengthen understanding,
not weaken authority.

This guide is binding for publication only.
