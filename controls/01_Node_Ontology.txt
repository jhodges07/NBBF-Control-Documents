01_Node_Ontology
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.1
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative Control Document
Scope: Definition, classification, and structural constraints of all budget nodes

--------------------------------------------------

1. Purpose

This document defines the formal ontology of the Node-Based Budget Framework.

It establishes:
- What constitutes a budget node
- The classification of nodes by decision authority
- Mandatory ownership, authority, cost, signaling, and exit requirements
- Structural constraints that prevent pooling, drift, concealment, and hostage budgeting

No budget authority, execution authority, or funded obligation may exist
outside this ontology.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Core Axiom — Human Authority

2.1 Human Node (Root Authority)

All nodes ultimately descend from a Human Node.

A Human Node is a real, named individual who:
- Bears legal responsibility
- Bears budget responsibility
- Publicly defends tradeoffs
- Exercises judgment under uncertainty
- Can authorize continuation, modification, or termination
- Can say “stop”

Automation, committees, algorithms, and agencies may assist,
but they may not replace human ownership or defense.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Definition of a Node

A Node is the smallest indivisible unit of budget authority or obligation.

A node is:
- A bounded decision or obligation
- With a single accountable owner
- A defined purpose
- Explicit inputs and outputs
- Measurable cost or resource claim
- Explicit exit conditions
- An associated signaling surface

A node is not:
- A department
- A political category
- A pooled fund
- A placeholder for future discretion

--------------------------------------------------

4. Node Classes by Decision Authority

Not all nodes are subject to Congressional vote.

Nodes are classified by **decision authority**, not merely by depth.

--------------------------------------------------

4.1 Decision Nodes (Voting Nodes)

Decision Nodes are nodes that require affirmative Congressional authorization.

Characteristics:
- Subject to Congressional vote
- Establish scope, ceilings, and constraints
- Allocate authority downward to child nodes
- Fewer in number and higher in the tree
- Collapse all dependent child nodes upon failure

Typical Decision Nodes include:
- Root Nodes
- Major Branch Nodes
- Program Nodes designated by statute or rule

Congress votes on decisions, not on execution details.

--------------------------------------------------

4.2 Assembly and Detail Nodes (Non-Voting Nodes)

Assembly and Detail Nodes decompose approved decisions into executable structure.

Characteristics:
- Not voted on individually by Congress
- Exist to expose cost structure, obligations, and execution detail
- Owned and defended by executive or operational owners
- Automatically collapse if the parent Decision Node loses authority
- Cannot expand scope beyond parent constraints

Typical Assembly and Detail Nodes include:
- Operational Nodes
- Support Nodes
- Cost decomposition nodes
- Execution and logistics nodes

Visibility does not imply voting authority.

--------------------------------------------------

5. Required Properties of Every Node

Every node must explicitly declare the following properties.

--------------------------------------------------

5.1 Identity
- Unique Node ID
- Plain-language Node Name
- Node Type
- Node Class (Decision or Assembly/Detail)

--------------------------------------------------

5.2 Ownership
- Single Human Owner (name and role)
- Parent node in the authority chain

--------------------------------------------------

5.3 Constitutional Authority
- Enumerated constitutional authority citation, or
- Explicit designation as non-enumerated authority
- Scope limitation statement

--------------------------------------------------

5.4 Cost and Resources
- Four-month funding request or allocation
- Unit cost assumptions
- Acceptable variance thresholds

--------------------------------------------------

5.5 Inputs
- Resources consumed
- Preconditions required

--------------------------------------------------

5.6 Outputs and Obligations
- Deliverables, capabilities, or services promised
- Observable expectations downstream

--------------------------------------------------

5.7 Performance Metrics
- Objective performance indicators
- Reporting cadence aligned to the four-month cycle
- Pass/fail criteria

--------------------------------------------------

5.8 Signaling and Reporting Surface

Every node must declare:
- Who is downstream of the node
- What authorized outcomes are visible to them
- The reporting channel for variance
- The escalation path for unresolved variance

Reporting rights may not be restricted by management hierarchy.

--------------------------------------------------

5.9 Exit Conditions
- Automatic termination triggers
- Review or suspension triggers
- Clawback conditions

A node missing any required property is invalid and ineligible for funding.

--------------------------------------------------

6. Allowed Node Types (Taxonomy)

Only the following node types are permitted.

--------------------------------------------------

6.1 Root Node
- Represents a constitutional authority domain
- Provides scope boundaries
- Holds no funding authority

--------------------------------------------------

6.2 Branch Node
- Organizes related nodes
- Holds no pooled funding
- Exists for structure and navigation

--------------------------------------------------

6.3 Program Node
- Represents a discrete government function
- Must decompose into assembly/detail nodes
- May not retain unallocated funds

--------------------------------------------------

6.4 Operational Node
- Executes a specific activity
- Holds direct cost and obligations
- Primary unit of execution accountability

--------------------------------------------------

6.5 Support Node
- Enables operational nodes
- Justified only by dependent nodes
- Automatically collapses if dependencies fail

--------------------------------------------------

6.6 Legacy Node
- Represents pre-existing obligations
- Scope is sealed and non-expansive
- Subject to sunset and termination rules

No other node types are allowed.

--------------------------------------------------

7. Structural Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

--------------------------------------------------

7.1 No Pooling
- No node may fund multiple unrelated purposes
- No aggregation of discretionary authority
- No obscuring of cost attribution

--------------------------------------------------

7.2 Single Ownership
- One node, one owner
- Committees review; they do not own

--------------------------------------------------

7.3 Default Zero
- All nodes default to zero funding
- Funding exists only by affirmative approval
- No baselines, auto-renewals, or silent extensions

--------------------------------------------------

7.4 Independence
- Failure of one Decision Node does not affect others
- No cascading failures
- No hostage leverage across nodes

--------------------------------------------------

8. Node Lifecycle (High Level)

--------------------------------------------------

8.1 Creation
- Fully specified before consideration
- Publicly visible at the appropriate clearance level

--------------------------------------------------

8.2 Defense
- Decision Nodes defended before Congress
- Assembly/Detail Nodes defended by owners and auditors
- Defense is recorded and archived

--------------------------------------------------

8.3 Funding
- Approved on a four-month basis
- Line-item approval at Decision Node level only

--------------------------------------------------

8.4 Monitoring
- Performance tracked against declared metrics
- Variance evaluated each cycle
- Signals may be generated by any downstream human

--------------------------------------------------

8.5 Termination
- Triggered automatically by exit conditions
- Clean and isolated collapse of dependent nodes

--------------------------------------------------

9. Ontology Invariants

The following conditions are always true:

- No spending without defense
- No authority without ownership
- No ownership without exits
- No exits without enforcement
- No pooled power
- No suppressed signals
- No hostage budgeting

--------------------------------------------------

10. Ontology North Star

Congress decides.
Executives assemble and execute.
Reality reports back.
Failure exits cleanly.

Every dollar has a name.
Every promise has a signal.
Every failure has an exit.

This ontology is binding.
