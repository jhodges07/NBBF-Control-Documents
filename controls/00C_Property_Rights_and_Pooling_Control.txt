00C_Property_Rights_and_Pooling_Control
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative Control Document
Scope: Property rights, consent boundaries, and anti-pooling constraints

GOVERNING AUTHORITY

This document is issued pursuant to the NBBF Root Control Document
(`controls/00_Control.txt`) and derives its authority therefrom.

All provisions herein are binding on all NBBF nodes, actors, and
derivative systems.

--------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE

This document establishes non-negotiable protections for property rights
within the Node-Based Budget Framework.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- No property is pooled without explicit, informed consent
- Authority cannot aggregate resources by implication or inertia
- Ownership, obligation, and liability remain traceable at all times
- Citizens retain exit rights from pooled arrangements

Pooling without consent constitutes structural expropriation.

--------------------------------------------------

2. PROPERTY RIGHTS PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All property originates with individuals.

Government possesses no independent property rights and may only
administer or temporarily steward property explicitly granted to it
under defined terms.

No node may:
- Assume ownership by mandate
- Convert use into ownership
- Treat access as consent
- Treat silence as agreement

--------------------------------------------------

3. CONSENT REQUIREMENTS FOR POOLING

Pooling of property, funds, labor, data, or risk requires:

- Explicit authorization
- Defined scope
- Defined duration
- Defined exit conditions
- Defined beneficiary class

Authorization must be:
- Specific, not general
- Time-bound, not permanent
- Revocable, not presumed

--------------------------------------------------

4. PROHIBITED POOLING MECHANISMS

The following are prohibited under NBBF:

- Implied pooling
- Retroactive pooling
- Mandatory pooling without exit
- Pooling via regulatory coercion
- Pooling justified solely by administrative convenience

Efficiency does not override ownership.

--------------------------------------------------

5. TRACEABILITY AND LEDGER REQUIREMENTS

All pooled property must be traceable to:

- Original owners
- Authorizing node
- Duration of pooling
- Conditions of use
- Conditions of release or return

Untraceable pooling constitutes a control failure.

--------------------------------------------------

6. EXIT AND DISENGAGEMENT RIGHTS

Every pooled arrangement must include:

- A defined exit mechanism
- A defined disengagement window
- A defined method for settlement or release

Exit may not be:
- Punitive
- Administratively obstructed
- Financially confiscatory

--------------------------------------------------

7. APPLICATION TO TAXATION AND FEES

Taxes, fees, and compulsory contributions are treated as pooled property
under this document.

Accordingly:
- Scope, duration, and use must be explicit
- Pooling authority must expire
- Renewal requires affirmative authorization

Permanent taxation is prohibited absent reauthorization.

--------------------------------------------------

8. VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Violations of this document trigger:

- Automatic invalidation of the pooling action
- Mandatory disclosure to oversight authorities
- Review in the next budget cycle
- Potential termination of node authority

Structural violations supersede administrative defenses.

--------------------------------------------------

9. CONTROL NORTH STAR

No authority may pool what it does not own.
No system may convert necessity into consent.
No program may survive by hiding ownership.

This document is a lock.
