NBBF 07 — Audit and Performance Standards
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative Standards Document (Publication Format)
Scope: Audit discipline, performance measurement, variance handling, and enforcement

--------------------------------------------------
NBBF 07.1. Purpose

The Audit and Performance Standards define how nodes are evaluated,
challenged, corrected, or terminated under the Node-Based Budget Framework.

Audits under NBBF are continuous, structural, and consequence-bearing.
They exist to preserve taxpayer supremacy, not to generate reports.

Key rules:
- Continuous audit, not episodic theater
- Performance is measurable
- Failure produces consequences

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.2. Audit Is Structural, Not Investigative

Auditing under NBBF is embedded in system design.

Audits are driven by:
- Node structure
- Signals and variance
- Declared scope and ceilings

Audits do not depend on whistleblowers, press exposure,
or political initiative.

Key rules:
- Structure triggers audit
- No discretionary initiation
- No selective enforcement

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.3. Continuous Performance Measurement

All nodes are measured continuously against:
- Declared scope
- Authorized cost
- Delivered outcomes
- Time and readiness constraints

Performance measurement is automatic and persistent.

Key rules:
- No grace periods
- No narrative substitution
- Metrics over explanations

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.4. Variance Definition

A **Variance** exists when:
- Costs exceed authorization
- Outcomes fall short of commitments
- Scope is exceeded
- Timelines are violated
- Signals contradict reported status

Variance is a system fact, not an accusation.

Key rules:
- Variance is objective
- Intent is irrelevant
- Delay is not mitigation

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.5. Signal-Triggered Review

Material variance automatically triggers review.

Review thresholds are:
- Declared at authorization
- Consistent across similar nodes
- Non-discretionary

No authority may suppress or delay a triggered review.

Key rules:
- Automatic escalation
- No managerial veto
- Signals override status

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.6. Audit Scope and Access

Audits examine:
- Node configuration
- Financial flows
- Operational execution
- Signal integrity
- Compliance with post-vote rules

Audit access may be classified,
but accountability may not be suspended.

Key rules:
- Full access to auditors
- Classification limits visibility, not audit
- No “need-to-know” obstruction

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.7. Performance Tiers

Nodes are evaluated into performance tiers, such as:
- Performing as authorized
- Underperforming
- Failing
- Abusive

Tier assignment is evidence-based
and recalculated each cycle.

Key rules:
- Tiering is public (within classification limits)
- Tiers drive consequences
- No permanent status

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.8. Corrective Action

Corrective action may include:
- Configuration changes below the voting node
- Scope reduction
- Funding reduction
- Mandatory restructuring
- Owner replacement

Corrective action does not require scandal or exposure.

Key rules:
- Proportional response
- Structural correction
- Speed over ceremony

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.9. Clawback and Recovery

When abuse or gross failure is identified:
- Funds may be clawed back
- Authorizations may be suspended
- Parked balance privileges may be revoked

Clawback is a system function, not a punishment.

Key rules:
- Rule-based recovery
- No negotiation
- No political shielding

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.10. Executive Accountability

Executive owners are evaluated on:
- Performance delivery
- Signal integrity
- Responsiveness to variance
- Avoidance of trivial activation
- Respect for post-vote constraints

Repeated failure results in loss of authority.

Key rules:
- Authority is conditional
- Performance is mandatory
- Tenure is not protection

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.11. Audit Independence

Audit functions operate independently of:
- Program management
- Political offices
- Budget negotiation processes

Audit interference constitutes a structural violation.

Key rules:
- Independence enforced
- Interference escalates automatically
- Retaliation prohibited

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 07.12. Failure Is Informative

Failure under NBBF is not hidden.

Failure:
- Generates learning
- Informs future authorization
- Reduces repeat waste
- Improves system resilience

Cover-up is worse than failure.

Key rules:
- Failure is visible
- Lessons propagate
- Silence is violation

NBBF 07.13. Audit and Performance North Star

Authority must be earned continuously.
Performance must be provable.
Failure must surface.
Correction must follow.
