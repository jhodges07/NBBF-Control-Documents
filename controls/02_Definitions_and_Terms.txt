02_Definitions_and_Terms
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.1
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative Definition Document
Scope: Binding definitions and controlled vocabulary for all NBBF documents

--------------------------------------------------

1. Purpose

This document defines the official meanings of terms used throughout
the Node-Based Budget Framework.

These definitions are binding.
No term may be reinterpreted, expanded, or narrowed outside the meanings
declared here.

Where ambiguity exists, the most restrictive interpretation governing
authority, spending, scope, duration, and secrecy shall prevail.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Core Structural Terms

--------------------------------------------------

2.1 Node

A **Node** is the smallest indivisible unit of budget authority,
obligation, or execution within the NBBF.

A node:
- Has a single accountable human owner
- Declares scope, purpose, and duration
- Carries explicit cost or resource claims
- Produces observable obligations and signals
- Contains explicit exit conditions

--------------------------------------------------

2.2 Human Owner

A **Human Owner** is a named individual legally and administratively
responsible for a node.

The owner:
- Defends the node’s authorization and performance
- Bears responsibility for variance
- May authorize execution within approved constraints
- May be removed for failure or abuse

Ownership may not be delegated to a committee, office, or process.

--------------------------------------------------

2.3 Decision Node (Voting Node)

A **Decision Node** is a node requiring affirmative Congressional authorization.

A Decision Node:
- Establishes scope, purpose, duration, and funding ceiling
- Defines the legal and operational envelope for execution
- May not be altered by the Executive after approval
- Collapses all dependent nodes upon termination

Authorization of a Decision Node constitutes formal Congressional consent
for the actions defined within its scope.

--------------------------------------------------

2.4 Assembly Node

An **Assembly Node** decomposes a Decision Node into executable structure.

Assembly Nodes:
- Are not voted on individually by Congress
- Exist to expose cost, obligations, and configuration
- May be reconfigured by the Executive within parent constraints
- Collapse automatically if the parent Decision Node loses authority

--------------------------------------------------

2.5 Detail Node

A **Detail Node** represents a reusable operational, logistical,
or support element.

Detail Nodes:
- May be referenced by multiple parent nodes
- Do not pool authority or funding
- Retain independent signaling and performance metrics
- May not bind parent nodes without an exit path

--------------------------------------------------

2.6 Support Node

A **Support Node** provides shared services or capabilities
to one or more operational nodes.

Support Nodes:
- May serve multiple departments or programs
- Are funded by explicit references from consuming nodes
- May not impose captive use
- Lose funding as consuming nodes exit

--------------------------------------------------

3. Financial Authority Terms

--------------------------------------------------

3.1 Scope

**Scope** defines the bounded purpose, actions, geography,
and operational limits of a node.

Actions outside declared scope are unauthorized.

--------------------------------------------------

3.2 Funding Ceiling

A **Funding Ceiling** is the maximum authorized allocation
for a node within a four-month cycle.

Ceilings may not be exceeded, replenished, or rolled forward
without reauthorization.

--------------------------------------------------

3.3 Four-Month Budget Cycle

The **Four-Month Budget Cycle** is the standard authorization,
defense, and review period under NBBF.

No funding persists beyond the cycle without affirmative renewal.

--------------------------------------------------

3.4 Reprogramming

**Reprogramming** is the transfer or redirection of funds
after Congressional authorization.

Under NBBF:
- Reprogramming is permitted only below a Decision Node
- Cross–Decision-Node reprogramming requires Congressional re-vote
- Unauthorized reprogramming is void ab initio

--------------------------------------------------

4. Sinking Fund and Reserve Terms

--------------------------------------------------

4.1 Sinking Fund Node

A **Sinking Fund Node** is a pre-authorized Decision Node
established to enable immediate executive action
under defined crisis or defense conditions.

A Sinking Fund Node:
- Has explicit triggers for activation
- Has a hard funding ceiling
- Has no automatic replenishment
- Must decompose into operational nodes upon use
- Is subject to accelerated signaling and oversight

--------------------------------------------------

4.2 Activation Event

An **Activation Event** occurs when funds are drawn
from a Sinking Fund Node or Reserve Node.

Activation triggers:
- Immediate decomposition into accountable operational nodes
- Enhanced reporting and signal generation
- Commencement of accountability and review timelines

--------------------------------------------------

4.3 Parked Balance (Debt-Offset State)

A **Parked Balance** is an unused portion of a Sinking Fund Node
temporarily loaned to the Treasury for the sole purpose
of retiring national debt.

Parked balances:
- Are not available for activation while parked
- Generate measurable interest savings
- Do not constitute spending
- May not be leveraged, traded, or pledged

--------------------------------------------------

4.4 Interest Savings Credit

An **Interest Savings Credit** is the quantified reduction
in federal interest expense resulting from parked balances.

Interest savings may be:
- Partially credited back to the originating sinking fund node
- Applied to general debt reduction
- Used only to increase resilience, not scope

--------------------------------------------------

5. Signaling and Accountability Terms

--------------------------------------------------

5.1 Signal

A **Signal** is any observable indication of performance,
delivery, failure, or variance generated by a node.

Signals may originate from:
- Downstream personnel
- Audits
- Operational data
- Field conditions

Signals may not be suppressed, delayed, or filtered.

--------------------------------------------------

5.2 Reporting Surface

A **Reporting Surface** is the defined interface through which
signals are submitted, escalated, and persisted.

Reporting surfaces:
- Bypass management chains
- Attach to nodes, not offices
- Persist until resolved or node termination

--------------------------------------------------

5.3 Exit Condition

An **Exit Condition** is a predefined trigger that terminates,
suspends, or modifies a node.

Exit conditions may be:
- Time-based
- Performance-based
- Audit-based
- Authority-based

--------------------------------------------------

6. Secrecy and War Authority Terms

--------------------------------------------------

6.1 Secret Node

A **Secret Node** is a node whose details are classified
for legitimate national security reasons.

Secret Nodes:
- Still have owners, costs, and exits
- Are visible in existence and cost range to authorized oversight
- Are subject to secrecy duration and unmasking rules

--------------------------------------------------

6.2 Declaration of War (Functional)

A **Declaration of War (Functional)** occurs when Congress
authorizes and funds a Decision Node whose scope includes
the use of military force.

Under NBBF, such authorization constitutes formal Congressional consent
for war within the defined scope, duration, and limits of the node.

--------------------------------------------------

7. Interpretation Rule

These definitions override:
- Customary usage
- Prior statutory phrasing
- Informal political language

If a term is undefined here, it has no binding meaning
within the Node-Based Budget Framework.

--------------------------------------------------

8. Definition North Star

Words define power.
Power must be bounded.
Boundaries must be explicit.

This document is binding.
