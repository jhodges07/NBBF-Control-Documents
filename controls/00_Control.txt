NBBF ROOT CONTROL DOCUMENT  
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0  
Date: 2026-02-01  
Status: Root Authority Control  
Scope: System-wide authority, control hierarchy, and publication governance

--------------------------------------------------

GOVERNING AUTHORITY

This document is the supreme control authority of the Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF).

All other NBBF control documents, nodes, actors, and derivative systems
derive their legitimacy exclusively from this document.

No control, budget, policy, process, or execution artifact may exist
outside the authority granted herein.

--------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE

This document establishes:

• The source of lawful authority within NBBF  
• The hierarchy of control documents  
• The rules governing publication, enforcement, and inheritance  
• The conditions under which authority may be exercised, limited, or revoked  

This document does not prescribe policy behavior.
It defines the *rules under which policy may exist*.

--------------------------------------------------

2. CONTROL HIERARCHY

Authority within NBBF flows strictly downward:

1. Root Control (this document)
2. Canonical Control Documents
3. Node-Specific Controls
4. Execution and Budget Nodes

No lower-level artifact may:
• Override a higher control
• Persist beyond its authorization
• Expand its scope without explicit control authority

--------------------------------------------------

3. CANONICAL CONTROLS

Canonical controls are authoritative policy controls that:

• Implement one and only one structural principle
• Are universally binding within their scope
• Are durable across budget cycles
• May only be amended by explicit versioned replacement

Canonical controls MUST:
• Declare their scope
• Declare their authority source
• Declare their enforcement mechanism
• Declare exit or termination conditions

--------------------------------------------------

4. PUBLICATION GOVERNANCE

Publication of control documents is governed by this root.

The following publication scopes exist:

• root_only — only this document is published
• canonical — only canonical controls are published
• all — canonical and subordinate controls may publish

Publication scope is declared in this document and enforced mechanically.

No document may self-publish.

--------------------------------------------------

5. IMMUTABILITY AND VERSIONING

Once published, a control document:

• May not be edited in place
• May not be silently superseded
• May only be replaced by a higher-version control
• Must preserve historical lineage

Authority is traceable or it does not exist.

--------------------------------------------------

6. ENFORCEMENT PRIMACY

Any node, actor, or authority operating outside the controls defined
under this root is operating without legitimacy.

Unauthorized action is null by definition.

--------------------------------------------------

7. FAILURE MODE

If this root control is:
• Missing
• Invalid
• Unverifiable
• Corrupted

Then:
• No controls publish
• No nodes are valid
• No authority exists

The system fails closed.

--------------------------------------------------

8. CONTROL NORTH STAR

Authority exists to be constrained.  
Power exists to be measured.  
Silence exists only where consent is explicit.

This document is the lock.
