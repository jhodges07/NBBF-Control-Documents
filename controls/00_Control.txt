00B_Signal_and_Non-Interference_Control
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative Control Document
Scope: System-wide signaling, reporting rights, and non-interference guarantees

GOVERNING AUTHORITY

This document is issued pursuant to the NBBF Root Control Document
(`controls/00_Control.txt`) and derives its authority therefrom.

All provisions herein are binding on all NBBF nodes, actors, and
derivative systems.

--------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE

This document establishes an inviolable signaling and reporting system
within the Node-Based Budget Framework.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Funded promises generate observable expectations
- Reality may speak back to authority without obstruction
- Bureaucratic suppression of failure is structurally impossible
- Citizen–Taxpayer Supremacy is preserved through ground-truth visibility

No funded node may exist without a protected path for variance reporting
from those affected by it.

--------------------------------------------------

2. UNIVERSAL SIGNAL PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every funded node creates obligations.
Every obligation creates observable expectations.

Any human downstream of a funded node has:
- The right to know what was authorized at their level
- The duty to report material variance between authorization and reality

Silence, obstruction, or suppression of variance reporting constitutes
a structural failure of the system.

--------------------------------------------------

3. MANDATORY REPORTING RIGHTS

Reporting rights apply to all persons downstream of a node, including but
not limited to:
- Enlisted personnel
- Officers
- Government employees
- Contractors
- Inspectors and auditors

Reporting rights:
- Do not require supervisory approval
- Do not flow through management chains
- May not be delayed, filtered, or reclassified to avoid escalation

Reporting is a system function, not a grievance process.

--------------------------------------------------

4. NON-INTERFERENCE CLAUSE

No person, office, agency, or authority may:
- Block a report
- Alter a report
- Delay transmission of a report
- Retaliate against a reporting individual
- Close a report without resolution at the appropriate node level

Any attempt to interfere with reporting constitutes an independent
node violation and triggers automatic escalation.

--------------------------------------------------

5. SIGNAL ESCALATION AND PERSISTENCE

Reports attach to nodes, not departments or individuals.

A report remains active until:
- The variance is resolved, or
- The node is modified, suspended, or terminated

Unresolved reports automatically escalate to higher nodes according to
predefined escalation paths.

No report may be buried by inaction.

--------------------------------------------------

6. EXECUTIVE BRANCH APPLICATION

All Executive Branch entities operating under NBBF authority are subject
to this document.

Execution authority does not include:
- Suppression of signals
- Reinterpretation of funded intent
- Substitution of process for delivery

Operational discretion exists only within funded and observable constraints.

--------------------------------------------------

7. CLASSIFIED AND SECRET NODES

Secret or classified nodes remain subject to this document.

Special rules apply:
- Reporting channels may be classified
- Access is limited to authorized Members of the House and Senate
- Classified Inspectors General receive reports

Secrecy restricts visibility, not accountability.

--------------------------------------------------

8. SECRECY DURATION AND UNMASKING

Every classified node must declare:
- A classification duration
- A review date
- An unmasking, declassification, or reauthorization event

Permanent secrecy is prohibited.

At minimum, existence, duration, and cost range must surface following
the declared period.

--------------------------------------------------

9. VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Violations of this document trigger:
- Immediate invalidation of interfering actions
- Mandatory disclosure to oversight authorities
- Automatic review in the next budget cycle
- Potential removal of node ownership or execution authority

Retaliation against reporting individuals constitutes a structural
offense, not a personnel issue.

--------------------------------------------------

10. CONTROL NORTH STAR

If the Republic funds it, reality must be allowed to speak.

No bureaucracy may silence truth.
No authority may outlive feedback.
No system may hide failure behind procedure.

This document is a lock.
