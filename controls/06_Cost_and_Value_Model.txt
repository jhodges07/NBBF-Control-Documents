NBBF 06 — Cost and Value Model
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative
Scope: Cost definition, value measurement, incentive alignment, and capital efficiency

==================================================

NBBF 06.1. Purpose

The Cost and Value Model defines how spending, restraint, and efficiency
are evaluated under the Node-Based Budget Framework.

It eliminates baseline spending, aligns executive incentives with taxpayer
outcomes, and makes restraint and debt reduction first-class achievements.

Key rules:
- No baseline or habitual spending
- Restraint is measurable and rewarded
- Every dollar must compete on value

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.2. Cost Is a Claim, Not a Fact

All costs under NBBF are treated as claims that require defense.

No cost is presumed valid due to history, urgency, or organizational status.
Every cost must be tied to a node, defended by a named human owner,
and re-evaluated each four-month cycle.

Key rules:
- No inherited legitimacy
- Human defense is mandatory
- Revalidation is continuous

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.3. Zero-Base as Default Condition

All nodes begin each budget cycle at zero funding.

Funding exists only through affirmative authorization with explicit ceilings
and time bounds. No silent carry-forward or automatic continuation is permitted.

Key rules:
- Default funding is zero
- Approval must be explicit
- Continuation requires reauthorization

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.4. Value Definition

Value is defined as outcomes delivered relative to resources consumed,
within declared scope.

Narratives, intent statements, and effort claims do not constitute value
without verifiable delivery.

Key rules:
- Outcomes over narratives
- Field verification matters
- Scope discipline is enforced

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.5. Opportunity Cost Is Explicit

Every dollar requested must disclose its opportunity cost.

Departments must acknowledge whether restraint could reduce national debt,
improve readiness, or outperform the proposed expenditure.

Key rules:
- Opportunity cost must be disclosed
- Debt reduction is a valid alternative
- Restraint is an evaluable outcome

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.6. Sinking Fund Cost Treatment

Sinking Fund Nodes represent preparedness options, not immediate spending.

While unused, sinking funds are evaluated for opportunity cost.
Upon activation, funds immediately convert into operational cost
and decompose into accountable execution nodes.

Key rules:
- Preparedness is not consumption
- Activation triggers accountability
- Decomposition is mandatory

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.7. Parked Balances and Debt Offset

Unused sinking fund balances may be placed in a parked balance state
for the sole purpose of retiring national debt.

Parked balances generate interest savings and are unavailable
for activation while parked.

Key rules:
- Debt retirement only
- No leverage, trading, or collateralization
- Parked balances are not discretionary spending

Reference:

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.8. Interest Savings Incentive

Interest savings generated by parked balances are calculated each cycle.

A defined portion of interest savings may be credited back to the originating
sinking fund to improve future preparedness, without expanding mission scope.

Key rules:
- Allocation is rule-based
- Restraint is rewarded
- Mission creep is prohibited

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.9. Anti-Hoarding Safeguards

Parked balances may not be rolled indefinitely.

Maximum parking duration is declared at authorization.
Continuation beyond that duration requires reauthorization.

Key rules:
- No indefinite parking
- Reauthorization is mandatory
- Shadow budgets are prohibited

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.10. Comparative Cost Visibility

All nodes publish cost-per-output and variance metrics.

Redundant or inefficient programs become visible by structure,
not accusation or investigative theater.

Key rules:
- Comparable metrics are required
- Transparency is structural
- Redundancy is exposed automatically

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.11. Executive Incentive Alignment

Executive performance includes delivery, signal responsiveness,
restraint, and effective use of parked balances.

Spending less than authorized, when justified, is a positive outcome.

Key rules:
- Restraint rewarded
- Signal quality matters
- Waste penalized

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.12. Prohibited Cost Practices

The following practices are prohibited under NBBF:
- Baseline budgeting
- End-of-cycle spending dumps
- Cost shifting to evade scrutiny
- Emergency claims without authorization

Violations trigger review, clawback, or node termination.

Key rules:
- No baseline budgeting
- No “use-it-or-lose-it”
- No cost evasion

--------------------------------------------------

NBBF 06.13. Cost and Value North Star

Every dollar must compete.
Every cost must defend itself.
Every restraint must be visible.
Every saved dollar must matter.
