00D_Exit_and_Disengagement_Control
Node-Based Budget Framework (NBBF)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Authoritative Control Document
Scope: Mandatory exit rights, disengagement mechanics, and authority termination

--------------------------------------------------

GOVERNING AUTHORITY

This document is issued pursuant to the NBBF Root Control Document
(`controls/00_Control.txt`) and derives its authority therefrom.

All provisions herein are binding on all NBBF nodes, actors, funding mechanisms,
and derivative systems.

--------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE

This document establishes mandatory exit and disengagement requirements
within the Node-Based Budget Framework.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- No authority persists by inertia
- No obligation is permanent by default
- Participation remains conditional and revocable
- Authority expires unless affirmatively renewed

Authority without an exit path constitutes coercion.

--------------------------------------------------

2. EXIT PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every funded node MUST include:
- A defined termination condition
- A disengagement mechanism
- A revocation pathway
- A sunset or renewal trigger

A node without an exit path is structurally invalid.

--------------------------------------------------

3. INDIVIDUAL DISENGAGEMENT RIGHTS

Any individual downstream of a node retains the right to disengage from:
- Participation
- Compliance obligations beyond lawful minimums
- Non-essential processes or requirements

Disengagement:
- Does not require permission
- Does not require justification
- May not be penalized beyond explicitly authorized consequences

No authority may compel continued participation absent explicit consent.

--------------------------------------------------

4. NODE-LEVEL TERMINATION

Each node must define:
- Conditions for suspension
- Conditions for termination
- Conditions for replacement or restructuring

If termination conditions are met:
- Authority automatically ceases
- Funding halts
- Obligations dissolve except for lawful closeout

No separate approval is required to end expired authority.

--------------------------------------------------

5. EXIT VS. FAILURE DISTINCTION

Exit is not failure.

Exit is:
- A designed system function
- A corrective mechanism
- Evidence of structural honesty

Suppressing exit signals constitutes system failure.

--------------------------------------------------

6. BUREAUCRATIC NON-ENTRENCHMENT

No office, agency, or actor may:
- Redefine exit conditions post hoc
- Substitute procedural delay for termination
- Extend authority through administrative interpretation
- Convert temporary authority into permanent structure

Persistence without renewal is prohibited.

--------------------------------------------------

7. EXECUTIVE BRANCH APPLICATION

Execution authority:
- Does not include the power to deny exit
- Does not include the power to redefine disengagement
- Does not include the power to delay termination

Execution ends when authority ends.

--------------------------------------------------

8. SEALED OR CLASSIFIED NODES

Classified or sealed nodes remain subject to exit controls.

At minimum, such nodes must disclose:
- Existence
- Duration
- Termination conditions
- Renewal authority

Secrecy limits visibility, not exit.

--------------------------------------------------

9. VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Violations of this document trigger:
- Immediate invalidation of unauthorized extensions
- Automatic escalation to oversight nodes
- Mandatory review in the next budget cycle
- Potential removal of node ownership or execution authority

Blocking exit constitutes structural coercion.

--------------------------------------------------

10. CONTROL NORTH STAR

Authority must be temporary.
Participation must be voluntary.
Exit must be real.

No authority survives without consent.
No system traps its participants.
No structure outlives its justification.

This document is a lock.
