GOVERNING AUTHORITY

This document is issued pursuant to the NBBF Root Control Document  
(`controls/00_Control.txt`) and derives its authority therefrom.

All provisions herein are binding on all NBBF nodes, actors, and  
derivative systems.

--------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE

This document establishes an inviolable signaling and reporting system  
within the Node-Based Budget Framework.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Funded promises generate observable expectations
- Reality may speak back to authority without obstruction
- Bureaucratic suppression of failure is structurally impossible
- Citizen–Taxpayer Supremacy is preserved through ground-truth visibility

No funded node may exist without a protected path for variance reporting  
from those affected by it.
